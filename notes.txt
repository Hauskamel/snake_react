============ the matrix:
the matrix is a 2d array containing 10 arrays, each containing 10 elements.
Each element is represented by either the integer '0' (= cell is clear) and '1' (= cell is not clear)

====== how does '0' flip to '1':
each element f.e. the 'Food' element by coloring the correct cell starts by
1. generating a random number between (0 multiplied by the number of rows and cols) in its class
2. numbers get passed down to matrix where they get converted so the array (set the integer in the correct column and row from '0' to '1')
3. matrix gives matrix array to 'Draw' class where it gets converted and displayed on the screen
